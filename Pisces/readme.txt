This is code for PisCES method.

Codes including: 
    choosek.m -- choose the number of communities
    eigencomplete.m -- perform matrix completion for cross vaidation (Li T, Levina E, Zhu J (2017) Network cross-validation by edge sampling. arXiv preprint
arXiv:1612.04717v4.)
    wLoss.m -- calculate modularity or log likelihood based on DCBM
    PisCES.m -- code for PisCES method with given alpha
    pisces_cv.m -- code for cross validation for choosing alpha
    
One example of how to use the code is showed in demo_for_pisces.m
